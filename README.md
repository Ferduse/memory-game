## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   https://www.w3schools.com/, Youtube.com, Stack Overflow 


2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   I encountered a few challenges when creating this submission because I haven't coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a while so it was a bit difficult however, the guide was very helpful. It linked many resources so I can read about it further and explore. Another problem I came across was the guess function for JavaScript and trying to complete the logic. Since I didn't code in JavaScript for a while, I forgot the syntax and how to write the code for this memory game. I tried writing the logic on my own and even googled the error codes I came across but it didn’t work out after multiple tries. I am glad it was difficult because I love the challenge and it just means I have to work harder and keep on learning. Another challenge was understanding the Sound Synthesis function. It was a bit confusing because there were so many things to follow. I was never exposed to adding audio using JavaScript. I used the guide to help me understand but I also used Stack Overflow, W3schools, and Youtube to clear up any pieces of information. Overall, this was an exciting and useful learning experience for me and I enjoyed every part of it! 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  
      What are the different types of pop-up boxes available in JavaScript? What other web development tools are there and what would you use to make this game better? What other CSS selectors can we use to change the appearance of the memory game?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   I would add additional features such as the optional features provided in the guide. I would add images to the buttons and change the sound that each button plays since it will be a fun and interesting process for both the players and myself. I would also want to create a better design for the game so it will attract more players to play and truly enjoy it. I would add a scoreboard too so players can defeat their own high score and other player’s high scores. Not only that but I would make different game modes for the memory game such as a game mode for speed and matching a sound to the button but it doesn’t light up. Adding different game modes and increasing the difficulty won’t make the game do one single thing - it can be and do more.
